The Employee Management System is a full-stack web application built with React (Vite), Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides a user-friendly interface for employees and administrators to manage workplace operations efficiently.

 Key Features:

 Employee Profiles – Employees can manage and update their personal details.

 Attendance Management – Track employee attendance with reporting features.

 Role-Based Access – Secure login system with separate dashboards for Admin and Employees.

Admin Dashboard – CRUD operations for managing employees, roles, and records.

 Reports Generation – Admin can generate detailed attendance and performance reports.

This project demonstrates my ability to design scalable full-stack systems with authentication, CRUD functionality, and clean UI/UX for real-world business use cases.
